# Automatic Redirect Implementation

## üéâ Automatic Redirect Without Page Refresh - IMPLEMENTED!

I've successfully implemented automatic redirect functionality that eliminates the need for users to refresh the page. The system now uses **React Router navigation** instead of `window.location.href` for seamless, instant redirects.

## üîß What Was Changed

### 1. **Created Redirect Service** (`src/authentication/redirectService.ts`)

- Centralized redirect management using React Router's `navigate` function
- Automatic toast notifications for user feedback
- Role-based dashboard redirects
- Session timeout handling

### 2. **Enhanced Token Service** (`src/authentication/tokenService.ts`)

- Uses redirect service instead of `window.location.href`
- Provides contextual error messages
- Seamless redirect on token refresh failures

### 3. **Updated App Structure** (`src/App.tsx`)

- Added redirect service initialization at app level
- Ensures navigate function is available throughout the app

### 4. **Improved Authentication Flow**

- All authentication failures now trigger automatic redirects
- No page refresh required
- Smooth user experience with toast notifications

## üöÄ How It Works Now

### **Scenario 1: Token Expires During API Call**

```
1. User makes an API request
2. Backend returns 401 (token expired)
3. System attempts token refresh automatically
4. If refresh fails ‚Üí INSTANT redirect to login (no page refresh)
5. User sees toast: "Your session has expired. Please log in again."
```

### **Scenario 2: Refresh Token Expires**

```
1. User loads the app
2. System checks stored tokens
3. Access token expired ‚Üí attempts refresh
4. Refresh token also expired ‚Üí INSTANT redirect to login
5. User sees toast: "Your session has expired. Please log in again."
```

### **Scenario 3: User Logs Out**

```
1. User clicks logout
2. Backend logout call
3. Clear all local data
4. INSTANT redirect to login (no page refresh)
5. User sees toast: "You have been logged out successfully."
```

### **Scenario 4: Unauthorized Access**

```
1. User tries to access protected route
2. Authentication check fails
3. INSTANT redirect to login
4. User sees toast: "Please log in to access this page."
```

## üéØ Key Benefits

‚úÖ **No Page Refresh Required** - Uses React Router navigation
‚úÖ **Instant Redirects** - Immediate response to authentication failures  
‚úÖ **User-Friendly Messages** - Toast notifications explain what happened
‚úÖ **Seamless Experience** - Maintains app state during redirects
‚úÖ **Centralized Logic** - All redirects handled by one service
‚úÖ **Role-Based Routing** - Automatic redirect to correct dashboard

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Expired Access Token**

```bash
# 1. Login successfully
# 2. Wait for access token to expire (or modify JWT expiry)
# 3. Make any API call
# 4. Should automatically redirect to login WITHOUT page refresh
```

### **Test 2: Expired Refresh Token**

```bash
# 1. Login successfully
# 2. Clear refresh token cookie in browser dev tools
# 3. Refresh the page
# 4. Should automatically redirect to login WITHOUT page refresh
```

### **Test 3: Manual Logout**

```bash
# 1. Login successfully
# 2. Click logout button
# 3. Should immediately redirect to login WITHOUT page refresh
```

### **Test 4: Protected Route Access**

```bash
# 1. Clear all localStorage data
# 2. Try to access /admin-side or /clearing-officer
# 3. Should immediately redirect to login WITHOUT page refresh
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Redirect Service Architecture**

```typescript
class RedirectService {
  private navigate: NavigateFunction | null = null;

  // Set navigate function from useNavigate hook
  setNavigate(navigateFunction: NavigateFunction) { ... }

  // Seamless redirect with toast notification
  redirectToLogin(message?: string, showToast: boolean = true) { ... }

  // Role-based dashboard redirects
  redirectToDashboard(role: string) { ... }
}
```

### **Integration Points**

1. **App Level**: Initialize redirect service with navigate function
2. **Token Service**: Use for authentication failures
3. **Auth Context**: Use for logout and session management
4. **Axios Interceptors**: Use for API authentication errors
5. **Protected Routes**: Use for access control

## üéâ Result

**Before**: Users had to refresh the page to see login page after token expiry
**After**: Users are instantly redirected to login with clear feedback messages

The authentication system now provides a **smooth, professional user experience** with automatic redirects that work seamlessly without any page refreshes! üöÄ

## üîç Monitoring & Debugging

To monitor the redirect behavior, check browser console for:

- `üîÑ Attempting token refresh...`
- `‚ùå Token refresh failed: 401`
- `‚úÖ Token refresh successful!`

Toast notifications will inform users about:

- Session expiration
- Logout confirmation
- Authentication requirements
- Unauthorized access attempts

# App Lock Implementation - Disable User Interactions on Token Expiry

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive app lock system that **disables all user interactions** when the refresh token expires, preventing users from clicking buttons or interacting with the app until they're properly redirected to login.

## 🔧 What Was Implemented

### 1. **App Lock Service** (`src/authentication/appLockService.ts`)

- **Global interaction disabling** using CSS pointer-events and user-select
- **Visual feedback** with overlay and loading spinner
- **Toast notifications** explaining why the app is locked
- **Auto-unlock mechanisms** with timeouts
- **Different lock types** for various scenarios

### 2. **App Lock Hook** (`src/authentication/useAppLock.ts`)

- React hook for components to use app lock functionality
- State management for lock status and reasons
- Easy integration with React components

### 3. **App Lock Overlay** (`src/components/AppLockOverlay.tsx`)

- **Full-screen overlay** that appears when app is locked
- **Loading spinner** and explanatory message
- **Prevents all interactions** while showing user what's happening

### 4. **CSS Lock Styles** (`src/global.css`)

- **Disables pointer events** on all elements when locked
- **Prevents text selection** and user interactions
- **Allows overlay to remain interactive** for proper UX

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Token Expiry Flow:**

```
1. User makes API request
2. Token expires → 401 response
3. System attempts token refresh
4. 🔒 APP LOCKS IMMEDIATELY - All buttons/interactions disabled
5. If refresh fails → App stays locked + shows message
6. After 2 seconds → Redirect to login (app remains locked during redirect)
7. User can't click anything until properly logged in again
```

### **Visual Experience:**

- ✅ **Full-screen overlay** appears instantly
- ✅ **Loading spinner** shows something is happening
- ✅ **Clear message** explains the situation
- ✅ **All buttons disabled** - nothing clickable
- ✅ **Cursor changes** to "not-allowed" on hover
- ✅ **Text selection disabled** throughout the app

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### **Test 1: Expired Refresh Token**

```bash
# Steps to test:
1. Login successfully
2. Open browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
3. Delete the refresh token cookie
4. Try clicking any button in the app
5. App should IMMEDIATELY lock with overlay
6. No buttons should be clickable
7. After 2 seconds → redirect to login
```

### **Test 2: Network Issues During Token Refresh**

```bash
# Steps to test:
1. Login successfully
2. Open dev tools → Network tab
3. Set network to "Offline" or "Slow 3G"
4. Wait for token to expire or force an API call
5. App should lock with "Network connection issues" message
6. All interactions should be disabled
```

### **Test 3: Manual Token Expiry**

```bash
# Steps to test (for developers):
1. Modify JWT expiry time in backend to 1 minute
2. Login successfully
3. Wait 1 minute
4. Try to click any button or make any interaction
5. App should lock immediately
6. User cannot interact with anything
```

### **Test 4: During Login Process**

```bash
# Steps to test:
1. Go to login page
2. Enter credentials and click login
3. App should briefly lock with "Logging you in..." message
4. On success → unlocks and redirects
5. On failure → unlocks and shows error
```

## 🎯 Lock Types Implemented

### 1. **Token Expiry Lock**

```typescript
appLockService.lockDueToTokenExpiry();
```

- **Message**: "Your session has expired. Please wait while we redirect you to login..."
- **Duration**: 5 seconds (with auto-unlock fallback)
- **Use Case**: When refresh token expires

### 2. **Network Error Lock**

```typescript
appLockService.lockDueToNetworkError();
```

- **Message**: "Network connection issues. Please check your internet connection."
- **Duration**: 10 seconds
- **Use Case**: When network requests fail

### 3. **Server Error Lock**

```typescript
appLockService.lockDueToServerError();
```

- **Message**: "Server error occurred. Please wait while we resolve this..."
- **Duration**: 8 seconds
- **Use Case**: When server returns 5xx errors

### 4. **Auth Process Lock**

```typescript
appLockService.lockDuringAuthProcess("Logging you in...");
```

- **Message**: Custom message (e.g., "Logging you in...", "Refreshing your session...")
- **Duration**: 3 seconds
- **Use Case**: During login/token refresh operations

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **CSS-Based Interaction Blocking:**

```css
.app-locked {
  overflow: hidden;
  cursor: not-allowed;
}

.app-locked * {
  pointer-events: none !important;
  user-select: none !important;
}
```

### **JavaScript Lock Management:**

```typescript
// Lock app
document.body.style.pointerEvents = "none";
document.body.classList.add("app-locked");

// Unlock app
document.body.style.pointerEvents = "";
document.body.classList.remove("app-locked");
```

### **React Integration:**

```typescript
const { isLocked, lockReason } = useAppLock();

// App automatically shows overlay when isLocked = true
// All components become non-interactive
```

## 🎉 User Experience Benefits

### **Before Implementation:**

- User clicks buttons after token expires
- Buttons might work or show confusing errors
- User doesn't know what's happening
- Poor user experience

### **After Implementation:**

- ✅ **Instant feedback** - app locks immediately when token expires
- ✅ **Clear communication** - user knows exactly what's happening
- ✅ **No confusion** - buttons simply don't work (as expected)
- ✅ **Professional feel** - loading spinner and overlay
- ✅ **Prevents errors** - user can't trigger broken functionality

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### **Console Logs:**

- `🔒 App locked: [reason]` - When app gets locked
- `🔓 App unlocked` - When app gets unlocked
- `🔄 Attempting token refresh...` - During token refresh
- `❌ Token refresh failed: 401` - When refresh fails

### **Visual Indicators:**

- Full-screen overlay with spinner
- Toast notifications explaining the situation
- Cursor changes to "not-allowed"
- All elements become non-interactive

## 🚀 Result

**Perfect Solution**: When refresh token expires, users **cannot interact with the app at all** - no button clicks, no form inputs, no navigation - until they're properly redirected to login. This provides a professional, controlled experience that prevents confusion and errors.

The app now behaves like a professional enterprise application where security and user experience are prioritized! 🎯
